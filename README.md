Assignment project from web course. I was tasked to create a one page adaptive or responsive website to promote existing TV shows. My website included a trailer,  poster or images, a synopsis of the plot story and links to social media. The website is hand code in HTML, CSS, and a bit of javascript / jquery to enhance the website.
