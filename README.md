# TV Show Website 

#### Chosen TV shows - Stranger Things Season 3 (Netflix show)
##### Project Date : May 2019 
Assignment project from web course. I was tasked to create a one page adaptive or responsive website to promote existing TV shows. My website included a countdown timer towards showing date, trailer,  poster or images, a synopsis of the plot story and links to social media, Netflix. The website was hand coded in HTML, CSS, and a bit of javascript / jquery to enhance the website.
